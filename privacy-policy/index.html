        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The Aurora Chronicles — by Entropy</p>
        <p class="effective">Effective date: February 14, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            The Aurora Chronicles is developed by kittikun and published by Entropy, a sole proprietorship (個人事業主) based in Tokyo, Japan.
            This policy applies to The Aurora Chronicles on all platforms, including Steam, iOS, and Android.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only what is necessary to provide the game experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entropy ID (optional):</strong> If you create an Entropy ID for cross-platform saves, we collect your email address and authentication credentials via Firebase Authentication (Google).</li>
            <li><strong>Save Data:</strong> If you use cloud saves, your game progress is stored on our servers and linked to your Entropy ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice Statistics:</strong> When you make in-game choices, your selections are recorded to prevent duplicate entries. By default, choices are linked to an anonymous identifier automatically generated by Firebase on your device. If you later create an Entropy ID, this same identifier is retained — no new ID is created. This data is stored on Supabase (cloud database). Other players only see aggregated percentages (e.g., "65% of players chose option A"), never individual choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Crash Reports (mobile only):</strong> On iOS and Android, we use Google Analytics for Firebase and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous usage data and crash reports. This helps us identify bugs and improve performance. This data includes device type, OS version, app version, and crash logs. It does not include personal information or gameplay content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you play without creating an Entropy ID, your save data remains local to your device. Choice statistics are still recorded using your anonymous Firebase identifier, but this cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

        <h2>3. What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect IP addresses or location data.</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics or tracking on Steam. Mobile analytics (Google Analytics/Crashlytics) collect only anonymous, aggregated data.</li>
            <li>We do not serve advertisements.</li>
            <li>We do not sell, share, or transfer any personal data to third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The following third-party services may process data on our behalf:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication (Google):</strong> Handles Entropy ID sign-in. Subject to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Stores choice statistics data linked to your Entropy ID. Subject to <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase &amp; Firebase Crashlytics (mobile only):</strong> Collects anonymous usage and crash data to help us improve the game. Subject to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Steam / Apple / Google Play:</strong> Platform purchases and accounts are governed by each platform's own privacy policy. We do not have access to your payment information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>
            Authentication data is stored using Firebase (Google Cloud) infrastructure. Choice statistics are stored on Supabase.
            We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Aurora Chronicles is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
            If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You may at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request a copy of your personal data</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your Entropy ID and all associated data</li>
            <li>Play the game without creating an account (local saves only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kittikun.jp">support@kittikun.jp</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
            Continued use of the game after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
